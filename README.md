# A minimal Alpine base image modified for Docker-friendliness

An Alpine Based Docker base image (Inspired by phusion/baseimage-docker), which has the my_init init, and some of the goodies from the Ubuntu based one.

Use this if you want to migrate from the Ubuntu base image to Alpine with a lower migration friction.
